            <h2>Steven Nesbitt - Street Comics</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a self-taught creative who makes music, streams, 
                writes comic books, and develops content. I stand before you today because my journey has been anything but conventional — I flunked out of art school, switched my major to computer science, went through therapy, and grew in ways I never expected. 
                Now, this path has led me to build this website, a hub for everything I create.

                I'm passionate about a variety of things, including travel, music, and art, and I can’t wait to share those experiences with you. My goal is to turn this space into a thriving community where like-minded creatives can connect.

                With a focus on simple yet complex creativity, I’m excited to have you along for the ride. Let’s see where this journey takes us!
