            <h2>Street Comics - Our Stories Are Ours To Write</h2>
            <p>
                This is the street comic initiative. 
The Street Comic Initiative came from an idea. I’ve nurtured it, cultivated it,  and I prepared it for this day.
 I plan to create some of the best content with everything that I am, and everything that I have. It is in an investment
  in what comes next. It is an investment into a future in which we create our own stories. It’s about turning passion into 
  action and showing that you don’t need much to make something great.  I want to inspire and encourage other creators because
   I love creating, and I want others to feel that same spark. Through this initiative, I’m self-publishing my first book, working 
   diligently on a webcomic, and planning to explore other forms of content as time goes on. But right now, it all starts here... 
   off the street.
